Java College Experiments – README
📘 Overview

This repository contains 10 core Java experiments completed as part of my college curriculum.
Each experiment focuses on important concepts of Java programming such as OOP, multithreading, exception handling, file handling, data structures, and more.

The aim of this project is to understand real-world Java concepts through hands-on coding and build a strong foundation in software development.

🧪 List of Experiments

Basic Java Program – Input/output, variables, datatypes

Control Statements – if-else, loops, switch

Arrays & Strings – operations, searching, sorting

Object-Oriented Programming – classes, objects, constructors

Inheritance & Polymorphism – method overriding & overloading

Abstract Classes & Interfaces

Exception Handling – try-catch-finally, custom exceptions

Multithreading – thread creation, synchronization

File Handling – reading/writing files

Java Collections Framework – List, Set, Map and operations

🛠️ Technologies Used
